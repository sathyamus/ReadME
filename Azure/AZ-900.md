#### Cloud computing
 -> Public Cloud
 -> Private Cloud
 -> Hybrid Cloud
 -> Community Cloud
    -> Govt zones
    -> Azure China
    -> Azure Germany

### Azure Fundamentals

#### Azure Data centers
  -> Regions
  -> Availability zones
  -> Azure Resource Groups
  -> Azure Resource Manager
     -> Azure portal
     -> Azure Powershell
     -> Azure CLI
     -> REST interface
  -> Resource Manager Templates
  -> Azure Advisor - optimizing resources

#### Azure services
  -> Global services (Azure active tenent etc)

#### Service Health
  -> Service issues
  -> Planned maintenance
  -> Health advisories
  -> Security advisories

#### Monitoring
  -> Metrics
  -> Alerts
  -> Workbooks
  -> Insights
  -> Applications
	  -> Virtual Machines
	  -> Storage accounts
	  -> Containers
	  -> Networks
  -> Log Analytics

#### Azure Mobile App

#### CLI / Powershell / Cloud Shell (Powershell / bash)

  * az --version
  * az login

#### Azure Compute
  -> Virtual Machine
  -> Containers
  -> Azure app service
  -> Serverless computing

#### Blob Tier types
  -> Hot tier
  -> Cold tier
  -> Archive tier

#### Blob service features
  -> Blob snapshots
  -> Blob leases
  -> Blob soft delete
  -> Static website hosting
  -> CDN integration
  -> Azure search services

#### Azure storage explorer 
  -> Windows application to connect and upload and download

#### Azure Data Migration Assessment

#### Azure Platform services
  -> IoT
  -> Azure Hub
  -> Azure central
  -> Azure Sphere

#### Azure BigData services
  -> HDInsight
  -> Databricks
  -> Synapses Analytics


#### Minimizing Azure costs .. focus on
  -> Reserved Instances
  -> Forecast / check the cost management
  -> Quotas (resources)
  -> Spending limits .. place alerts with threshhold
  -> Azure Hybrid benefits (on-prem to Azure migration etc), like lift and shift


#### Microsoft Azure Administrator: 
##### Implement and Manage Virtual Networking

  -> Service Endpoint
   -> Virtual Network -> Service Endpoint -> Add
   -> Storage Accounts -> Firewall and virtual networks
  -> Private Endpoint - prevent inbound internet access to certain azure services
     -> Can be used with Azure DNS
     -> Private link center -> create
       -> Resource group -> instance name (privatestorageblob) 
          -> Subscription, Resource Type (Mircrosoft.Storage/storageAccounts), Resource, Target sub-resource (blob, blob secondary, web etc)
          -> Virtual network, subnet

  -> VNet peering
    -> private routing path
    -> service chaining (Hub vnet, spoke vnet) spoke resource to route the traffic
    -> No azure provided name resolution



##### Secure Access to Virtual Networks

  

##### Network Watcher

##### Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs)

##### Azure Bastion
  -> TLS ... 443 .. HTTPS
  -> AzureBastion subnet --> secure access (RDP, SSH)
  -> Can not integrate with JIT access
  -> No service chaining
  -> Fully managed ... can't stop, no RDP policy
  -> only from Browser experience as of Oct 2020

##### Azure Firewall
  -> User config
  -> DNS
  -> tunneling
  -> force ingress
  -> force egress
  -> can auto scale

  -> NAT Rule collection
  -> Network rule collection
  -> Application rule collection

##### Azure LoadBalancer


##### Azure App Gateway and Web Application Firewall
  -> SSL Termination
  -> Auto scaling
  -> Zone redundancy
  -> Static VIP
  -> Web Application Firewall
  -> Ingress controller for AKS
  -> URL based routing
  -> Multi site Hosting
  -> Redirection
  -> Session Affinity
  -> Websocket and HTTP /2 traffic
  -> Connection draining
  -> Custom error pages
  -> Rewrite HTTP Headers and URL
  -> Sizing

##### Azure Traffic manager

##### Azure Front Door
  -> Frontends / domain
  -> Backend pools
  -> Routing rules

##### Network Security Group
  -> Inbound rules
  -> Outbound rules
