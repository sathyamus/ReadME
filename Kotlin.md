- val and var
- "val" refers to "values" (which can not change) and "var" refers to "variables" (which can change) 
- No concept of types in Kotlin, not even void. Everything in Kotlin is an object, much like Ruby
- Classes and properties in Kotlin 
- Extension Functions 
- When working with Kotlin, you donâ€™t have to write public keyword again. By default, everything is of public scope. 
- Introducing Inheritance 
- In Kotlin, all classes extend from Any, which is similar to Object in Java. By default, classes are closed, like final classes in Java. So, in order to extend a class, it has to be declared as *open* or *abstract*
